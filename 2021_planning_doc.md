## INIDUN Project Goals and Planning for 2021

Following up on our last meeting of 2020, this document includes:

* Suggested goals for VT21
* Suggested (specific, delimited) tasks
* An outline of a work flow, specifically related to the tasks in question

### GOALS for 2021

1. Complete and submit one article, on text analysis of UNESCO SSIs: **15 June 2021**
   * Create (and publish?) a jupyter page related to this article     
     * _QUESTION_: is this jupyter page a _tool for writing_ the article, or primiarly a way of _showing_ how the work was done?
     * _ANSWER_: Both! But in different ways. We should use the newly launched Jupyter pages as one means of working with the SSI corpus. Eventually, we may choose to create a specific jupyter page, related to a particular pulbication and designed for public viewing. 

1. Complete text curating of _Courier_
   * Goal: a finalized corpus, ready for machine reading: **15 December 2021**
   
1. Complete text curating of _Proceedings_ 
   * Goal: a finalized corpus, ready for machine reading: **15 December 2021**
   
1. Participate in conference(s)
   * Already scheduled: History of Concepts Conference, Berlin, 2-4 September 2021 (Ben)
   * Identify relevant conferences, apply
     * Idéhistoria på gång, Lund, May 2021 (?) 
     * ENIUGH Congress, Åbo, June 2021
     * EADH Congress, Krasnoyarsk, Russia, September 2021 [Nope]
     * Digital History in Sweden, Umeå, December 2021
   * Plan our own (small) event, for 2022
     * Decide re: date and theme of event by **15 June 2021**

1. Sign partnership agreement with UNESCO
   * Publicize this agreement

### WORK FLOW

**Suggested Order of Events:**
  During VT21 we will pursue two tasks in parallel:
  1. SSI article (and related text analysis tasks) (VT21)
  1. Curating _Courier_ 
  * Curating _Proceedings_ will probably not be until HT21.

1. Work Flow for SSI Article
   1. F and B explore corpus in jupyter (and various of its outputs in Excel).
   1. F and B identify most relevant methods for this article
   1. If we want to create a public, article-specific jupyter page: 
      * F and B present tools-request to R and A
      * R and A make tools available on a new jupyter page  
Or:

* _IDEA: plan this as a set of "scrum sprints"_
   1. Sprint 1: 
      * F and B work with corpus in excel and/or Voyant
      * F and B identify trends, arguments, and most relevant methods
      * OUTPUT of sprint: 
        1. A decision re: which approaches to focus on 
        1. An outline of main arguments 
        1. A detailed, specific tools-request, to present to R and A (maybe)
      * (Maybe repeat this sprint a few times)
   1. Sprint 2:
      * R and A create jupyter page, based on F and B's request and using existing tools
      * OUTPUT of sprint: a jupyter page.
      * Sprint Review: A meeting where R and A present the page 
      * A follow-up meeting to work through questions and bugs
   * Suggested dates: 
      * Sprint 1: Feb 1 - Feb 16
      * Sprint 2: ?

1. Work Flow for Text Curating (in general)
   * Get what we can from UNESCO directly. Then, once we know what UNESCO can/cannot offer: 
   * Plan targeted scraping
     * Identify texts to collect:
       * Use metadata from UNESCO to create list
       * Quality control of metadata lists
     * Write scraping code
   * Conduct scraping
   * Quality control 
   * Identify curating needs (based on research questions) (B and F)
   * Create specific list of curating tasks
   * Complete curating tasks
   * Quality control / testing
   
### TASKS

1. Tasks: SSI Article
   1. Launch writing space in google drive (done)
   1. Divide up tasks.
      * Suggestions: Two parallel tracks:
        * Moretti-style exploration of the corpus (Fredrik)
        * Explore issues in the existing scholarship empirically and quantitatively (Ben)
   1. F and B move forward separately 
   1. Meet and compare results: First meeting, **16 February**
      * Meeting goals (after one or more meetings):  
        1. A decision re: which approaches to focus on 
        1. An outline of main arguments 
        1. (Maybe) A detailed, specific tools-request, to present to R and A
   
1. Tasks: Text curating
  1. Finalize communication with UNESCO archive re: metadata lists and file access (Ben)
  1. Courier:
     * None right now? 
  1. Proceedings:
     * Identify and isolate relevant text (Ben)
     * (Once we have reliable digital text versions) Mark up text with tags for: start of each speech, speaker, country, etc.        
   1. (In the meantime) Study the Material
      1. Read through parts of _Proceedings_ (Ben)
        * Identify issues for machine reading/curating
        * Take notes on content and themes 
      1. Read through parts of _Courier_ (Fredrik)
        * (same as for Proceedings, above)
      1. Develop list of curating tasks for R and A
      * _QUESTION_: When is this finished? (What is the benchmark?)
      
1. Re: Conferences
   1. Write proposal to EADH Conference: [DEADLINE: 24 Jan 2021] (Ben) (Decided not to do this.)
   1. Write proposal to ENIUGH Conference: [DEADLINE: 15 Feb 2021] (Ben)
