# Memo regarding UNESCO standard-setting instruments (SSIs)

UNESCOs SSIs consist of three groups:
* Conventions
* Resolutions
* Declarations

We have already downloaded all of these. See the [excel file with list of these](https://github.com/inidun/unesco_data_collection/blob/master/data/legal_instrument_index.xlsx).

Additional note: in one case, UNESCO also published background documentation related to a particular SSI:
* Declaration on Mass Media (28 Nov 1978): see ["Historical Background of the Mass Media Declaration" (1982)](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000047669).

Are there more like this? Searching for "historical background" in UNESDOC does not reveal any others.

*Update, 4 August 2020*
I added the texts to three SSIs (in the data file legal_instrument_corpus.txt) where the files were empty (2003, 2017, 2019). 


*Quality control of the texts (27 August 2020)* 
The SSI texts we have downloaded do not include the title at the top of the file (with the exception of the Constitution of UNESCO). That might be good, since those words are not, in fact, part of the treaty text, I suppose. It does make it hard to see which one you're looking at, but we are unlikely to read the texts in this form ourselves, and anyway the titles are visible in the excel list of all the SSIs. So I think that not having the titles in the text files is as it should be. Leaving as is for now.
