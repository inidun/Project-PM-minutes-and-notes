# Memo regarding UNESCO standard-setting instruments (SSIs)

UNESCOs SSIs consist of three groups:
* Conventions
* Resolutions
* Declarations

We have already downloaded all of these. See the list of them (where?).

Additional note: in one case, UNESCO also published background documentation related to a particular SSI:
* Declaration on Mass Media (28 Nov 1978): see ["Historical Background of the Mass Media Declaration" (1982)](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000047669).

Are there more like this? Searching for "historical background" in UNESDOC does not reveal any others.
