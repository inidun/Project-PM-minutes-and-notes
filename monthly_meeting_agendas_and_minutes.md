## Minutes from INIDUN monthly meetings


### Meeting, 3 November 2020 (via zoom) 

_Agenda_

1. Updates: 
   1. Partnership agreement (almost) done
   
1. Working with UNESCO SSIs:
   1. Status of jupyter page(s) for working with this corpus?
   1. Discuss process for working on an article using (only) this corpus:
      - order of work
      - division of labor
      - time-frame

1. _Courier_:
   1. _Courier_ metadata excel file: all ok? 
      - Plan for storing, updating, versioning
   1. Downloading _Courier_ texts. Eng (at UNESCO) says a batch download "might take a while" and encourages us to think of a plan B. What could that be?
   1. Scraping _Courier_: possible? Already done? Problems?

1. Proceedings:
   1. Discuss a Plan B (if UNESCO cannot arrange batch download)
   1. Scraping Proceedings: How much was already done? OCR/text quality? Can this be done again with better quality?
   
1. Review our mode of working
   1. Using the kanban. Useful? How to make more dynamic?
   1. Other changes needed? Should we meet more often (next year), or in a different way? 
   

### Meeting, 6 October 2020 (in Umeå)

_Agenda_

1. Updates, status
1. Work with UNESCO SSIs
   1. Look together at current set of text analysis tools.
   1. Using index (for example: ways to measure how many countries, absolute number and % of total number of member states, signed/adopted which of the resolutions and declarations?) 
   1. Compare to work B and F did with SSIs for Lund talk (in Voyant)
   1. Discussion of _meaning_ of co-occurrences plotted as graph...!
   1. Tools for Moretti-style analysis of SSIs?
   1. Discuss an article using (only) this corpus; order of work, division of labor?
   1. Set time-frame for work on such an article
1. _Courier_: 
   1. Status (F and B report) 
   1. Next steps?
1. Proceedings
1. Other matters
   1. Reading group re: relevant DH methods (incl re: digital conceptual history)?


_Notes_

- The new text analysis tools should be opened and used in jupyter at inidun.humlab.umu.se. The code is stored in GitHub.
- We added several issues regarding new features to add to new Word trends tool (word_trends.ipynb at inidun.humlab.umu.se), in part inspired by Moretti and Pestre, "Bankspeak."
- Decision: we will focus, for the SSIs, on a small group of tools: 
  - word trends
  - most discriminating words
  - collocates
  
Roger will try to re-use tools from CultIntSoc and Westac (common things are kept in area called penelope). Timeline? 
He will let us know when the new versions (in jupyter) are ready to use. 

In the meantime, B and F will focus on: 
- identifying arguments (in the scholarly literature) to test in the corpus
- developing argument about what exactly the SSI corpus is and can show. What is its value as an object of study?
- developing argument about value of digital approaches at all, given small size of corpus
- Timeframe: try to complete and submit an artile on SSIs early in 2021.   


Re: curating UNESCO _Proceedings_

B will continue discussing w UNESCO how to get whole downloads of text files.
Then, B will work on tagging/marking up these texts with # markers, designed to facilitate cutting up the text into usable pieces and creating metadata. These can be inserted into the text file before the text in question, to mark:
1. when a particular session of the General Conference begins: #SESSION_START
1. when a new speaker begins speaking, including UNESCO title (where relevant), country, and language (only EN or FR): #SPEECH_INDIA_EN

B can start doing this with one or two years of _Proceedings_; eventually we might get help from a paid student or other support. 

In the meantime:
- B and F can read up on UNESCO (especially, for F, _Courier_). In each case, they will think about what the corpus _is_, and what sorts of things it can allow us to say. That is, once we are able to do text-analytical work with these corpora, we want to be ready to make an argument about what claims about these corpora show about history and the world (!).   



###  Meeting, 1 September 2020 (via zoom)

_Agenda_ 

1. Updates, status
1. Status of UNESCO SSIs
   1. Quality-controlled?
   1. Desired text analysis tools
   1. Time-frame for work on an article using (only) this corpus
1. _Courier_: Status, next steps?
1. Proceedings: time frame for working on this?
1. Other matters?

_Meeting notes_

Three main results from today's discussion:

1. Roger and Andreas will focus during September on putting together a jupyter page with a few text-analysis tools for use on the SSI corpus. These will include:
   * PoS-tagging
   * a word trends tool, to measure word frequencies, etc.
   * a collocate measuring tool, with: 
     * adjustable window size
     * ability to export results for visualization in Gephi
   * a tool to identify most discriminating terms of each document (probably through Tf-idf)
     * ideal if this can be used also to identify the most discriminating terms of all documents in one time period as compared to other time periods (see division of corpus into three groups in INIDUN/unesco_data_collection/data/legal_instrument_corpus (dates first) in 3 groups.txt 

1. Ben will continue working on SSI, focusing on:
   * Learn more about how they work, which countries sign them, which are universal and which regional, etc. Will enter results into: https://github.com/inidun/Project-PM-minutes-and-notes/blob/master/Source_PM_3_SSIs.md
   * Quality control: Clean up the English in the text files
   * Continue work on developing historical arguments about the SSIs that can be tested/illustrated through digital text analysis. Writing on this will be in: https://github.com/inidun/Project-PM-minutes-and-notes/blob/master/UNESCO%20SSI%20paper%20notes.md
   
   
1. Ben and Fredrik will move forward with _Courier_:
   * Ben will contact UNESCO re: 
     * Can we have meta-data on all Courier articles?
     * Can we have Courier files in an XML format, rather than as PDFs?
   * Fredrik will:
     * Test extracting text from several issues, in different decades, to see how long it would take to do this manually.
     * Contact people (like maybe the author of this [page on Document Layout Analysis](https://github.com/BobLd/DocumentLayoutAnalysis)) to ask for advice on state-of-the-art methods for solving problems of the kind _Courier_ presents.
     * Continue reading in (and about) Courier, to familiarize us with the material.
       * Tip: Maria Simonsen, "Routes of Knowledge: The Transformation and Circulation of Knowledge in the UNESCO Courier, 1947-1955", in J. Östling et al., _Forms of Knowledge: Developing the History of Knowledge_ (Lund, 2020).
